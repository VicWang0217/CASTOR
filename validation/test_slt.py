"""The `lulin` profile's SLT half, against the night behind it.

Companion to test_lulin.py, which does the same job for LOT. Where these
disagree with presets.json, presets.json is what is wrong — every number
asserted here came out of real frames, and `slt.py` records how.

Note what is asserted about extinction: that it is *absent* from presets.json.
The night produced a k per band and the k is not trustworthy; slt.py's
WHY_NO_EXTINCTION has the evidence. These tests pin both halves of that — the
ordering, which survives, and the absence of the values, which must.
