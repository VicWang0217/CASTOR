"""Where each number in presets.json came from.

The file was written before anything could check it, and when the checks arrived
every value that had one turned out wrong — four filters that were placeholders,
a throughput 2.6x high, a telescope carrying its neighbour's focal ratio, a
camera with the wrong sensor's pixels. That is not what a partly-sourced file
looks like. It is what an invented one looks like, and the right prior for
anything still unaccounted for is that it was invented too.

So every value is listed here with its origin, and `test_provenance.py` fails if
the file holds a number this table does not, or holds a different number than
the one recorded. Changing a preset now means saying where the new value came
from. Values marked GUESS are not defects to be hidden — they are the honest
state of the file, and the point of naming them is that nobody has to rediscover
which ones they are.

Sources, strongest first:

    MEASURED   derived from the observatory's own frames in this suite
    DOCUMENT   a manufacturer datasheet or the observatory's published pages
    DERIVED    computed from a MEASURED or DOCUMENT value
    GUESS      no source. Believe nothing about it.
