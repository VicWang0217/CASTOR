"""SLT against the one night that looked like it could measure extinction.

`lulin.py` is the LOT half of this: 123 frames, 18 nights, one sightline. It
closed a great deal and could not close two things — per-band extinction
(QUESTIONS.md 4) and anything at all about SLT (QUESTIONS.md 5) — because no
single night in it spans more than 0.19 in airmass, so its extinction fit
measured night-to-night transparency wearing an airmass term's clothes.

This module is the night that looked like it would. 2024-04-14, SN2024ggi,
SLT: 241 frames in five Sloan bands sweeping airmass 1.81 to 3.72 in one run,
which is exactly the observation `lulin.py`'s own "what would settle it" note
asked for — and it still could not, for a reason that took a second look to
find. See "Why there is no extinction here" below. What survives is SLT's
throughput, the first that exists for this telescope, and the *ordering* of
extinction with wavelength.

Method, which differs from lulin.py in two ways that matter:

    Reference catalogue is SkyMapper DR4, not Pan-STARRS DR2. This field sits
    at declination -32.8, outside PS1's footprint — not a preference, a fact
    checked directly: the same MAST cone search returns 2769 stars at the LOT
    field's +38.4 and zero here. SkyMapper's natural u/v/g/r/i/z system is
    close to but not identical to SDSS/Sloan, and NO COLOUR-TERM TRANSFORM HAS
    BEEN APPLIED, so every number below carries an unquantified systematic on
    top of the fit error quoted. That is the single biggest caveat here and the
    reason these values are not simply better than lulin.py's.

    Aperture radius follows each frame's own measured FWHM (2.5x, sky annulus
    4-6x) rather than a fixed size. Seeing swung 2.8 to 4.6 px within this
    night; a fixed aperture loses a seeing-dependent fraction of the flux, and
    that alone put 0.2-0.4 mag of false scatter into the first pass at this fit.

Frames are not committed — the repository is public and they are the
observatory's. `data/lulin/README.md` has the standing rule; what came out is
here, and `test_slt.py` checks presets.json against it.

#: An hour of this night was not photometric, and the fit says so before any

#: fully, which is the subject of WHY_NO_EXTINCTION.

#: Why this night measures extinction's shape but not its size.
#:
#: The decisive test needs no model. Take frames at the SAME airmass from early
#: and late in the night: the extinction term is identical between them by
#: definition, so any difference in zero point is transparency alone. Pairing
#: the 12:0x-14:2x frames against the 14:50-15:35 ones at matched airmass, the
#: sky is fainter later in every band —
#:
#:     g' 0.40 mag   r' 0.17   i' 0.11   u' 0.35   z' 0.14
#:
#: The cloud passed and the sky never came back. And because the target was
#: setting, the second half of the night is also the high-airmass half: a
#: transparency decline and an airmass rise, moving together, are exactly what
#: `zp = zp0 - k*X` cannot tell apart. It attributes the fade to airmass and
#: inflates k.
#:
#: The size of the inflation matches the size of the fade, band by band. Against
#: literature values for a good site (u' 0.55, g' 0.20, r' 0.11, i' 0.07,
#: z' 0.06), the excess is +0.06 / +0.29 / +0.15 / +0.13 / -0.01 — and g',
#: which faded most, is inflated most. That correlation is the evidence that
#: the excess is weather rather than a genuinely dusty site.
#:
#: Re-fitting on the post-cloud ascending branch alone (X 2.2-3.5, internally
#: consistent) lowers everything but does not rescue it: it yields
#: u' 0.605, g' 0.485, r' 0.258, i' 0.197, z' 0.049, which is still 2-3x
#: literature in g'r'i' while u' and z' land near it — not a physical
#: extinction curve, since real extinction is smooth in wavelength. The drift
#: continues inside that branch too.
#:
#: What survives: extinction falls monotonically towards the red, which every
#: cut of this dataset agrees on and which the LOT 18-night fit could not even
#: get the sign of. What does not: any absolute value. presets.json therefore
#: keeps the site-wide 0.17 fallback, and QUESTIONS.md 4 stays open.

#: The four-night follow-up, which confirmed the single night rather than
#: rescuing it. 2024-04-14 above is one of four SN2024ggi nights that each sweep
#: airmass 1.81 to ~3.8 (04-12/13/14/16). The obvious hope was that a joint fit
#: — one extinction shared across nights, a free transparency term per night —
#: would separate the airmass slope from the weather that one night could not.
#: It does not, and the fit says why in its own covariance. See
#: `reduce_slt_extinction.py` (862 frames re-reduced against the same SkyMapper
#: refs) and `analyze_slt_extinction.py`, which reproduces the numbers below
#: from the committed per-frame zero points.
#:
#: The reason is structural, not bad luck: the target is southern (dec -32.8)
#: and Lulin is at +23.5, so it is setting from the moment it clears the east —
#: airmass rises monotonically with time on EVERY night, not just 04-14. So a
#: per-night transparency term and the shared extinction stay collinear on every
#: night, and adding nights adds no lever. 04-13 in fact clears through the
#: night (stars brighten as they set), which shows up as negative apparent
#: extinction; 04-16 is the most internally consistent night and on its own
#: still returns negative k in u'g'r'i'. Neither is a measurement of the air.
